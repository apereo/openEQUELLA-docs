Changes in status from active to emeritus and from emeritus to active will be determined by a simple majority of active PMC members. Status changes can be initiated by request of the PMC member concerned at any time.

## Removal of PMC chair and vice-chair

A PMC member, whether active or emeritus, may resign at any time for any reason.

A PMC chair or vice-chair can be removed at any time, with or without cause, by a vote of no confidence comprising a simple majority of active PMC members.

## Voting

In general, voting is by lazy consensus:

**Vote: Meaning**

+1: Approve

0: Abstain

-1: Disapprove

-1 - Votes must be accompanied by a detailed explanation. A single -1 vote based on a material objection will block action. However, -1 blocking votes can be overridden by a 2/3 majority roll call vote of active PMC members.

Voting will be open for a period of 3 working days (Saturdays and Sundays excluded).

Proposals should contain the following text:

_As a reminder, this is a public, on-list vote with a "+1" signifying approval. Per our governance documents, a -1 vote must be accompanied by a detailed explanation. A single -1 vote based on a material objection will block action. However, -1 blocking votes can be overridden by a 2/3 majority roll call vote of active PMC members._

## Elections

Nominations for Chair and Vice-Chair should be made publicly and can include self-nominations.

If there is only one candidate, the nominee is usually just declared elected.

If a vote is required, it is usually secret with an unbiased PMC member (e.g. not a candidate, such as current PMC chair) gathering the votes and reporting the results.
