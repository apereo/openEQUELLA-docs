# Log Review 2

**_ Recommended for use only by individuals with a strong understanding of the Equella system _**

This is a Java utility that loops through the file directory structure of a cluster of Equella resource-centre logs, and reports on the 'search facets'
found. Due to the sheer number of log messages possible in a cluster of EQ nodes over days, this utility uses a PostgreSQL DB to build the
reports.

### Setup

Note: Releases of LogReview2 files are stored in the Equella Tools directory

#### Needed Files

- LogReview2 jar
- control.json (see Config Details for contents)
- creds.properties (see Config Details for contents)

#### General

The utility outputs 3 files: A file with all log review details, a file with only the log review details of 'found' search facets, and a file for 'unknown' errors / warnings.

Ensure a PostgreSQL DB is running.

To invoke, run this utility as follows:

```
$ java -jar logReview2_v[[latest version]].jar control.json creds.properties
```
