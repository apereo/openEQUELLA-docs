## openEQUELLA 2018.2 Features Overview

This guide provides an overview of the features released in openEQUELLA 2018.2.

The following features are included:

- **Views counts for summary pages and attachments** - Views counts can now be displayed for
  summary pages and attachments. See [Usage Counts](#usage-counts).
- **Streamlined process for attaching openEQUELLA resources during contribution** - an option to
  remove a number of dialogs during the selection of EQUELLA resources during contribution has
  been added. See [Streamlined openEQUELLA Resource Attachments](#streamlined-openequella-resource-attachments).
- **Course selector updated across openEQUELLA** - the course selector has been updated to allow
  searching of Title, Code and Description with a scrollable list. See [Course Selector](#course-selector).
- **HTTP Referrers added to log** - HTTP referrers are now captured in the audit log to enable
  identification of an item’s LMS usage. See [HTTP Referrers](#http-referrers).
- **Theme Editor** - a new Theme Editor is available to apply colour schemes to the new UI template
  and search page components and to upload logos. See [Theme Editor](#theme-editor).
- **Scripting API** - Navigation of Control and XML objects are now enhanced. See [Scripting API](#scripting-api).
- **Docker** - Enhanced runtime environment and a build environment are now available. See [Docker](#docker).

### Important note regarding facet configuration

In openEQUELLA 6.6, when enabling the new Search UI page prototype, a simple facet search editor
enabled configuration of facet searches. Due to the further development of the new Search UI and
the creation of APIs for facets, openEQUELLA 2018.2 no longer has the facet search editor available.

Additionally, if facets were configured in your openEQUELLA 6.6 Search UI, upgrading to
openEQUELLA 2018.2 will result in those facets no longer displaying on the new Search UI page.
However, facets can be re-configured or created using REST APIs. It is expected that a user-friendly
Search UI Editor that will enable the configuration of default search pages including facets will be
included in our next release.

## Usage Counts

Suitably privileged users can view usage counts for both summary pages and attachments.

_NOTE: Counts start accumulating once the system is upgraded to openEQUELLA 2018.2._

### New ACL for Usage Counts

Users with the new ACL **VIEW_VIEWCOUNT** granted will be able to see the new view counts
displayed for each item and attachment.

### View Summary Page Views Counts

The Summary page **Views** count displays in the Details section of an item summary page for users
with the new VIEW_VIEWCOUNT privilege granted. An example is shown in Figure 1.

![alt text](images/OpenEquella20182FeaturesGuide/Figure1SummaryPageViewCount.png "Figure 1 Summary Page View Count")

**Figure 1 Summary Page View Count**

The **Views** count shows the total number of views for the currently opened version of the item. The
number of views for each version of an item can also be viewed.

To view the Views counts for all item versions

1. Open the required item’s Summary page.
1. Click the **show all** link in the _Details_ section, next to the _Version_ number. The **Versions of this item** page displays, showing the **Views** for each version. An example is shown in Figure 2.

![alt text](images/OpenEquella20182FeaturesGuide/Figure2VersionsOfThisItemViewsCount.png "Figure 2 Versions of This Item - Views Count")

**Figure 2 Versions of This Item - Views Count**

### View Attachment View Counts

Attachment view counts display in the attachment drop-down for each attachment for users with the
new VIEW_VIEWCOUNT privilege granted. An example is shown in Figure 3.

![alt text](images/OpenEquella20182FeaturesGuide/Figure3AttachmentViewCount.png "Figure 3 Attachment View Count")

**Figure 3 Attachment View Count**

### Smart vs Normal Logging

Logging type (SMART or NORMAL) can be set in the _mandatory.properties_ file. Setting SMART logging
allows usage counts to occur per session rather than each time a user opens a summary page or an
attachment.

For example, if SMART logging is set, when a specific item summary page is opened multiple times by
a user in one session, the count will only go up by 1. If NORMAL logging is set, the count will increase
by one each time the user opens that item’s summary page during that session.

## Streamlined openEQUELLA Resource Attachments

When selecting existing openEQUELLA resources as attachments for an item, an option has been added to
reduce the number of pages that display during the process. Removing these pages provides a more
streamlined experience for contributors.

### Set Skip Checkout Page Option

A new option to **Skip checkout page** displays on the Attachments page in the Collection Definition
Editor.

To set the 'Skip checkout page' option

1. Open the **Collection Definition Editor** for the relevant collection from the Administration
   Console.
1. From the _Wizard_ tab, select the relevant **File attachment** wizard control. An example is shown in
   Figure 4.
1. Make sure the **openEQUELLA Resources** attachment type is selected in the **Allow the following
   attachment types:** section.
1. In the openEQUELLA Resources configuration section, select **Skip checkout page**.
1. Select **Save**.

**Figure 4 New openEQUELLA Resources Option on the Attachments Wizard Page**

### Attach openEQUELLA Resources With New Option Selected

Once this option has been saved, the checkout page no longer displays during the contribution
process.

An example of the pages that display when selecting and returning openEQUELLA resources during
contribution when the new option is selected are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.

![alt text](images/OpenEquella20182FeaturesGuide/Figure5ResourcesSelected.png "Figure 5 Resources Selected")

**Figure 6 Contribution Wizard Page With Returned openEQUELLA Resources**

If required, the **Edit** link beside each attachment can be used to make changes to the display name of the attachment.

## Course Selector

The openEQUELLA Course Selector has been updated to be scrollable and searchable. Any search
string entered will be matched with data stored in the Course Title, Description and Code fields. All
instances of the Course Selector within openEQUELLA have been updated.

An example with the scroll bar displayed is shown in Figure 7.

![alt text](images/OpenEquella20182FeaturesGuide/Figure7CourseSelectorWithScrollBar.png "Figure 7 Course Selector With Scroll Bar")

**Figure 7 Course Selector With Scroll Bar**

An example with search terms and results is shown in Figure 8.

**Figure 8 Course Selector With Search Terms and Results**

## HTTP Referrers

HTTP referrers have been added to the database audit log, which enables reporting and identification
of the integrated LMS instances in which an item is being used.

Examples of a Postgres database with LMS HTTP referrers are shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10.

![alt text](images/OpenEquella20182FeaturesGuide/Figure9PostgresHttpReferrersForIntegratedLmss.png "Figure 9 Postgres - HTTP Referrers for Integrated LMSs")

**Figure 10 Postgres - HTTP referrers for Integrated LMSs - Magnified**

## Theme Editor

The new Theme Editor enables administration users to apply theming to the new openEQUELLA UI
template, by selecting a colour scheme for page components and uploading a logo.

### Accessing the Theme Editor

The Theme Editor is accessed from the UI category of the Settings page.

#### To Access the Theme Editor

From the UI category of the Settings page, select the Edit Theme Settings button. An example is
shown in Figure 11.

### Applying a Colour Scheme

Colours can be selected and applied to specific areas of pages. Colours can be set for seven separate
components of the pages, however some of those components only display as part of the new Search
UI page.

#### Colour Scheme settings

The **Colour Scheme** area includes seven components, and colours can be set for each. Once colours
are selected, the **Apply** button is used to the refresh the page and apply the new colours.

The **Undo** button is used to undo the changes made within a configuration session (prior to the _Apply_ button being used).

The **Reset to default** button is used to return to openEQUELLA default colours.

##### To Apply New Colours

1. Click the colour panel of the page component to be changed (for example, Primary Colour). A
   colour selector displays, as shown in Figure 13.
1. Select the required colour by entering the HEX or RGB codes, if known, or by clicking one of the
   solid colour squares at the bottom, which will change the colour palette. Select the required
   colour by clicking in the colour palette. An example is shown in Figure 14.

## Scripting API

### Scripting API SBT Task

You can now build the 'Scripting API' documentation from the current codebase.

From a clone of the Equella repository, run `sbt writeScriptingJavadoc`. The javadoc API will be placed in Equella/target .

### New XMLScriptType API Methods

New methods were added to the XML script object to allow ease of traversing the XML tree:

- XmlScriptType getParent()
- List<XmlScriptType> getChildren()
- String getName()

A code example of using these API calls can be found in [PR #545](https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/pull/545).

### New ControlScriptObject Methods

New methods were added to the Control script object to allow ease of navigating controls in repeaters / groups:

- ControlScriptObject getParent();
- int getIndex(ControlScriptObject child);

A code example of using these API calls can be found in the issue thread for [#475](https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/issues/475).

## Docker

Docker abilities were enhanced to allow a more consistent environment for building Production worthy installers / upgraders, and to provide a consistent runtime environment. Please see the /docker folder's README for the Docker openEQUELLA [runtime environment](https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/tree/master/docker#default-dockerfile) and [build environment](https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/tree/master/docker#docker-build).
