## Security overview

openEQUELLA security is designed using Access Control Lists (ACLs) for flexible top-down management, allowing system administrators to manage user access to objects (collection definitions, metadata schemas, etc.), tasks, and resources within the repository.  Management of self-contributed objects and resources can be delegated to users.

openEQUELLA security enables the definition of suitable security defaults, so that specific settings seldom need to be defined when objects are created.

The purpose of this guide is to provide administrators with an overview of the various security settings available and an understanding of their configuration and use.

Please note that this guide has been developed to best reflect the full capabilities of openEQUELLA, and as such may differ in appearance to your own installation.

Where possible the examples in this guide are provided in the openEQUELLA Vanilla Institution.   

## Access control lists

After an openEQUELLA installation, the system administrator will implement security settings as required by their institution. This typically requires modification of the default ACLs.

An ACL associates a Grant or Revoke action and a User, Group or Role with an openEQUELLA privilege on an object. For example, the EDIT_SCHEMA privilege might be granted to users having the System Administrator role.

ACLs can be configured using the object’s Access Control or Security page or the Administration Console Security Manager.

### Roles
To ease management of ACLs and users, it is recommended that ACLs be associated with roles (which have users allocated to them) rather than specific users or groups. This provides a degree of independence from the user management system and avoids the rapidly increasing complexity created by assigning ACLs to individual users.

Roles are defined using the Internal Roles plug-in available from the Administration Console User Management tool.

**Privileges**

openEQUELLA provides a privilege for every system task. Privileges have an associated object (for example, a resource, workflow, collection etc.) and can also have a textual string (e.g. EDIT_SCHEMA=edit this schema). The raw privilege (EDIT_SCHEMA) only is displayed in the Security Manager and the string (edit this schema) is displayed on the object’s Access Control or Security page.

### Actions
Each ACL element has an associated Grant or Revoke action.

## Security Manager reference

The Security Manager provides access to ACLs for all institution objects. Institution objects are displayed in a tree hierarchy with folders containing groups of objects and child objects.

### Security Manager
The Security Manager is accessed through the openEQUELLA Administration Console.

To access openEQUELLA and open the Administration Console:
1.  Open a browser and enter your openEQUELLA URL (e.g. ‘http://equella.myequellainstitution.edu’).
2.  Log in to openEQUELLA as an administrator, select Settings then Administration console.
3.  The Administration console displays. Select Security Manager.
4. The Security Manager page displays
The Security Manager hierarchy represents the ACL hierarchy. Object groupings are displayed as folders, and these groupings contain child objects representing institution objects. Each hierarchy node can have zero or more associated ACLs.

The child objects listed in the hierarchy consist of user interface elements, resource items and tasks. They are shown at the lowest level of the hierarchy.

### ACL inheritance
The Security Manager shows the ACL inheritance. Any object can inherit an ACL from any of the object groupings above it. ACL privileges are refined per grouping. At the Institution level, all privileges are available, while at the Object level they are limited to those applicable to that object, typically EDIT_OBJECT and DELETE_OBJECT.

### Object ACLs
Typically the ACLs for objects can be set at object creation in either the Administration Console tools or the Security Manager, while ACLs for groupings (such as schemas or portlets) can only be set in the Security Manager. This security hierarchy has been developed to minimize the security configuration required by object creators by allowing administrators to specify grouping defaults that are inherited by any created objects.

### Determining access using ACLs
Access to an object is determined by analysis of its ACL. Default lists are provided but typically require customization to suit the requirements of individual institutions.

An ACL comprises an ordered list of actions that grant or revoke privileges set on each object, and actions inherited from the parent object. Inherited actions have a lower precedence than actions set on an object unless they are set to override child actions. Example ACLs are shown in the following series of figures.

The security tree is traversed from top to bottom, looking for ACLs that are associated with the user.
Important points to note are:
For an individual ACL:
* If its Override checkbox is unticked, it can be overridden by ACLs further down the tree.
* If its Override checkbox is ticked, it cannot be overridden by ACLs further down the tree.

## Security hierarchy reference

The top two levels of the Security Manager hierarchy are the same for all openEQUELLA installations.

These levels are intended to provide the default ACLs configured by the system administrator. Carefully chosen defaults will decrease the work required by object creators during the creation process.

### Typical object grouping
Typically groupings will only contain objects that have been created for the openEQUELLA instance: Advanced Searches, Schemas, Remote Repositories, Courses, Taxonomies, LTI consumers, HTML editor plugins, User Scripts, Connectors, Hierarchy, External Tools, Stores, EchoSystem servers, Reports, Workflows, OAuth Clients, Dynamic Collections, Hierarchy, Kaltura servers , Harvester Profiles, Custom Links, Regions, Catalogues, Tiers, Payment Gateways, Storefronts and Store Taxes.

Collections, Portlets, Management Pages, Resources and System Settings have further groupings as outlined in the following sections.

### Collections object grouping
The Collections grouping contains all the collections created for an institution. Each collection contains two further groups:
* Resource Metadata Rules—these are set at a collection level.
* Resource Statuses—these ACLs inherit from the resource’s status and can be set within the Security Manager. It is recommended, however, that modifications to individual collections be maintained by the collection owner.

These groupings do not provide another level of ACLs for their child objects.

### Portlets object grouping
The Portlets grouping contains the portlet types that can be added to a user’s dashboard. ACLs are set on the portlet type, not on the individual portlet itself.

### Management Pages object grouping
The Management Pages grouping allows ACLs to be set on the management pages. ACLs set at the grouping level will apply to all child sites. Settings can also be made on the individual pages at the child level.

### Resources object grouping
The Resources grouping provides a mechanism for finding actions associated with a resource. The ACLs associated with the objects within this group are inherited by all system resources.

The Resources grouping object is unique; the grouping object provides a mechanism for finding the actions associated with a resource. The ACLs associated with the objects within this group are inherited by all system resources.

Each resource status is treated separately in the Security Manager as statuses represent the state of a resource rather than the resource itself. An override option is provided anywhere a status ACL can be set.
Resource statuses have the following inheritance:
* Institution—privileges set here are applied to all resources regardless of status.
* Resources—privileges set here are applied to all resources with the selected status.
* Collections—privileges set here are applied to all resources of all collections.
* Specific Collection Resource—privileges set here are applied to all resources of a particular collection with the selected privilege.

### System Settings object grouping
The System Settings grouping allows ACLs to be set against each object to restrict what is available on the Settings page accessed from the navigation menu. These settings contain the various configuration options for a wide range of functions across the openEQUELLA system, and would normally be restricted to those with administration rights for the relevant functions.

### View/Modify ACLs
1.  Select an object from the Security Manager hierarchy to display the ACLs for the selected object (e.g. Schemas) in the View/Modify ACLs pane. This pane lists the ACLs and allows addition, removal and modification.

Elements of the View/Modify ACLs pane are:
#### Add button
Click + Add  to add a new line to the list. The new line is populated with data entered from the previous step. If the ACL pane is blank, the first line added will display the default action Grant - < X >\_OBJECT - Everyone.
#### Remove button
Click - Remove  to delete the selected line from the list.

(NOTE: Removing an action from an ACL cannot be undone. Actions removed in error must be recreated manually.)
#### Movement arrows
Use the up and down arrows to rearrange the order of the list.

#### Action column
Apply a Grant or Revoke action to the selected privilege. Click on the action to enable a drop-down list and select an option.

#### Privilege column
Click on an element in this column to enable a drop-down list of applicable privileges (e.g. CREATE_SCHEMA, DELETE_SCHEMA and EDIT_SCHEMA).

#### Who? column
Select a user, group or role to be associated with the selected privilege. Click on an element in the column to display a Select Recipients dialog.

#### Override? column
Select the Override? checkbox to give the selected action precedence over other actions in the list.

(NOTE: The override is typically only given to those with System Administrator privileges.)

#### Save button
Click Save  to save changes.

#### Close button
Click Close to display the Save Changes dialog and exit the Security Manager.

### Select Recipients dialog
Elements of the Select Recipients... dialog in the Security Manager can include:
#### User entity pane
Displays users, groups or roles associated with the selected privilege. New ACLs have the default Everyone displayed in this pane.

It is good security practice to remove this user type when granting privileges to other users. Select Everyone and click <  to remove it from the list.

#### Search tab
The Search page searches the selected user entity (Users, Groups or Roles) for the text entered in the search criteria. A blank search text field is equivalent to a wildcard only search and, in this instance, returns all available users. The only special character recogniZed in this search field is the wildcard: asterisk (\*). Multiple users can be selected using the Shift or Control keys. Once selected, the user entity list can be modified using the button controls:

Left Arrow —Add the selected user(s) to the user entity list.
Right Arrow  —Remove the selected user(s) from the user entity list.

Select an element (e.g. System Administrator Role) from the Results list and move it to the right-hand pane by clicking >.

#### Browse tab
If a large number of users need to be selected, it can be more effective to use the Browse page rather than the search function.

The search fields have the following properties:
##### Groups
Search institution groups for names that match the entered text. A blank entry field returns all institution groups. Group search results are returned in the pane immediately below the entry field.
##### Users
Select a group to search for users in the selected group who match the entered text. A blank search entry field returns:
* all users in the selected group; or
* all institution users when no group is selected.

Multiple users can be selected using the Shift or Control keys. Once selected, the user entity list can be modified using the button controls:
  * Left Arrow —Add the selected user(s) to the user entity list.
  * Right Arrow —Remove the selected user(s) from the user entity list.

Select an element (e.g. INT - System Administrators) from the results list and move it to the right-hand pane by clicking >.


### Network tab
The Network page associates an action with an IP address or referring URL.
#### Add an IP Address
Enter an IP address in standard 255.255.255.255 format and a subnet mask in CIDR notation, a number between 0–32. The subnet mask represents the number of bits masked from the starting bit of the IP address. An example IP address and mask of 192.168.102.127/24 will allow access from IP addresses in the range 192.168.102.0 to 192.168.102.255.

#### Add a HTTP Referrer
1.  Enter a text string that will be matched to the URL of the recipient.
* Only match this exact referrer—the recipient URL must match the entered referrer URL exactly.
* Match referrers containing this value—the recipient URL must contain the entered referrer text string. The entered text string does not need to be a resolvable URL.

### Other tab

The Other page associates generic user entities with an action. These user entities represent groupings that cannot be easily specified using any of the other methods.

#### Everyone
Represents everyone who can access this instance of openEQUELLA. This group includes everyone who can access an openEQUELLA URL and comprises Guest and Logged in users.
#### The owner of the targeted object
Represents object owners, typically object creators.
#### Logged in users
Represents users who are logged into this instance of openEQUELLA.
#### Guest users
Represents users who can access the openEQUELLA URL without logging in.
#### Single signed on with identifier
Represents users who are logged on using the Shared Secrets plug-in. This option is mainly for use with third-party integrations.

### Create advanced user entity lists
User entity lists are expressions whose evaluation for the current user determines access to objects. The user entity list consists of user and groupings (expression operators) that can be combined to create an expression of arbitrary complexity. User entity lists can be created by identifying a user or users to be matched using the default Match Any grouping but occasionally a more sophisticated list is required. Important considerations when creating user entity expressions are:
* Readability—use the most readable expression. This makes maintenance by other users easier as the intent of the expression is clearly stated.
* Simplicity—use the simplest possible expression to achieve the required user access.

The available groupings are:
* Match Any—equivalent to the Boolean OR operator. When used at the top level of a user expression, a user belonging to any one of the user entities in this group can use the associated privilege.
* Match None—equivalent to the Boolean NOT operator. When used at the top level of a user expression, a user belonging to any one of the user entities in this group cannot use the associated privilege.
* Match All—equivalent to the Boolean AND operator. When used at the top level of a user expression, a user must belong to all the user entities in this group to use the associated privilege.

To change a grouping, the grouping drop-down list must be enabled. Enabling the drop-down is linked to the rename folder functionality of the Operating System.
* For Microsoft Windows™—press F2 or perform a slow double-click to enable the drop-down.
* For most other systems—select the operator and triple-click the name to enable the drop-down.

### Add Grouping button
Click  Add Grouping to add a new user entity grouping with the default Match Any operator.
### OK button
Click OK to save changes and close the Select recipients dialog. The Who? Column in the View/Modify ACLs pane is populated with the selection.

### Cancel button
Click Close  to close the dialog without saving changes.


## Access Control reference

Objects with configurable security in the openEQUELLA Administration Console have either an Access Control tab or a Security tab that provide multiple methods for configuring ACLs. This sections below describe access control options for individual objects.

## Administration Console objects

Administration Console objects with configurable security are:
* Metadata Schemas
* Collection Definitions
* Advanced Searches
* Taxonomies
* Dynamic Collections
* Workflow Templates
* Hierarchy Editor
* Reporting
* Harvester Profiles
* Remote Repositories
* Courses

Access control is configured on the Access Control tab, with the exception of Collection Definitions that have a Security tab. The Collection Definitions—Security tab has three further tabs: Access Control, Resource Status ACLs and Resource Metadata ACLs.

### Configure access control

The Access Control page provides a choice of three modes for configuring access: Basic, Advanced and Do not specify.

Elements of the Access Control page are:
* Who can...?—a drop-down list containing all available privileges for the object. The privilege name is presented as a textual string (e.g. delete this schema) instead of the actual privilege name (e.g. DELETE_SCHEMA).
* Basic, Advanced and Do not specify—selects the interface for creating the ACL. Configuration is maintained when switching from Basic to Advanced mode but will be lost when switching from Advanced to Basic mode. Select from the radio buttons to display the related page beneath the line.

### Basic mode
The Basic interface provides a simplified interface where users and privileges can be configured.

Elements of the Basic page can include:

#### Entity list
Determines the user entity that will be associated with the specified privilege and can include:
* Just the owner—the object owner, typically the object creator. (NOTE: This entity is not displayed on the Collection Definitions—Access Control page in Basic mode.)
* Everyone—all users who can access this instance of openEQUELLA. This group includes everyone who can access an openEQUELLA URL and comprises Guest and Logged in users.
* Everyone except guests—all logged on users.
* A limited set of users, groups, and/or roles—select particular users, groups or roles to be associated with the specified privilege.

#### Select button
Enabled when A limited set of users, groups, and/or roles is selected. Click Select  to display the Select Recipients... dialog.
#### Save button
Click Save  to save changes.
#### Close button
Click Close  to return to the Administration Console, or to discard the changes.
#### To search for user entities:
1.  Select the A limited set of users, groups, and/or roles radio button.
2.  Click Select  to display a Select Recipients... dialog.
Elements of the Basic mode Select Recipients dialog are:
* Search tab—searches the selected user entity (Users, Groups or Roles) for the text entered in the search criteria.
* Browse tab—if a large number of users need to be selected, it can be more effective to use the Browse page rather than the search function.
* User entity pane—displays users, groups or roles associated with the selected privilege.

3.  Select user entities (e.g. Content Administrator Role and System Administrator Role) from the Results pane.
4.  Click right arrow  to move selections to the right-hand pane. Click left arrow  to remove individual entities, or <<  to remove all entities.
5.  Click OK   to add entities to the access list.

### Advanced mode
The Advanced interface provides fine-grained access control.

Elements of the Advanced page are:
#### Action table
Can display actions, user entities and override flags for this privilege. Click on an action in the Action column to enable a drop-down list with Grant and Revoke options. Click on a user entity in the Who? column to display a Select Recipients dialog similar to that in the Security Manager.  The Collection Definition Editor—Access Control page can display an Override? column, depending on the selected privilege.

The Override? column is not displayed on the Collection Definition Editor—Access Control page for the following collection privileges:
* Who can allow search filtering by this collection?
* Who can contribute resources with this collection?
* Who can delete this collection?
* Who can edit this collection?

#### Add button
Click +Add to add an action to the bottom of the action list. The first action added defaults to a Grant action, while adding further actions creates a clone of the previous action.
#### Remove button
Click -Remove to remove the selected action from the list.
#### Movement arrows
Use the up and down arrows to change the position of the selected action.
#### Show overriding ACLs
Check the Show overriding ACLs checkbox to display inherited ACLs that override actions for this privilege above the action table.
#### Show default ACLs
Check the Show default ACLs checkbox to display inherited ACLs that do not override actions for this privilege below the action table.

### Do not specify mode
The Do not specify interface is not configurable.

User access remains as the default set in the Administration Console Security Manager.
1.  Click the Show inherited privileges that will apply link to display an action list showing users, groups or roles associated with the selected privilege.


## Collections Security tab
The Collections object has a Security tab that has four further tabs: Access Control, Resource Status ACLs, Resource Metadata ACLs and Dynamic Metadata ACLs.

### Resource Status ACLs tab

The Resource Status ACLs page configures access privileges that depend on the state of resources within the collection. This can be useful for changing user access depending on where the resource is in a workflow. The Resource Status ACLs page provides all the functionality of the Access Control page with an additional control for selecting the resource status that is associated with the action.

##### For resources that are...
Select a resource status for this action from the drop-down list. Resource statuses include: draft, live, rejected, moderating, archived, suspended, deleted, and review.

### Resource Metadata ACLs tab
Resource metadata ACLs control access is based on information (metadata) about a resource. Resource metadata includes status, workflow progress, user role or item schema data. The Resource Metadata ACLs page enables the creation of named scripts that are evaluated to determine user access. Scripts can be arbitrarily complex and include one or all of the metadata types. When a script is evaluated, it will return either true or false. When a true value is returned, the action associated with the script is used to determine user access.

The elements of the Resource Metadata ACLs page are:
* Hierarchy pane—displays a list of scripts.
* Script editor pane—displays properties of the selected script.
* Add—click to add a new script to the hierarchy pane.
* Remove—click to delete the currently selected script from the list.

Elements of the Script Editor pane are:
##### Name
Enter or edit the name of the selected script (e.g. Reviewers).
##### If a resource’s metadata matches… tab
Comprises the Basic and Advanced tabs of the Script Editor. Scripts provide automatic selection of actions based on metadata attributes.
##### …then apply the following… tab
Associates an action with the script and uses the same access control interface as the Access Control tab.

### Dynamic Metadata ACLs
The Resource Metadata ACLs (static) provides a means of setting permissions based on individual metadata values across a collection. Dynamic Metadata ACLs extend this functionality to enable the creation of permissions dynamically based on User, Group or Role Ids stored in the resource metadata.

Once a Dynamic Metadata rule is set up for a collection, and a User, Group or Role ID stored in the metadata (which may be added via a selector during contribution, a Save script, checklists etc.) is found to match a value in the selected ID Type table (User, Group or Role), the ACLs pre-set for the selected objects will be allocated dynamically.

For example, an openEQUELLA group could be set up for each course an institution offers, and the users (students) enrolled in that course are added to the group. A dynamic metadata rule is created which sets the path, ID type (in this case, group) and the ACLs (privileges) that will be applied when a match is found during contribution. When the value of the metadata node for the group selector matches the group ID, the ACLs are automatically created.

In the above example, the following steps are completed to configure the dynamic metadata ACLs rule:
* Add a user, group or role selector to the relevant contribution wizard (including creating a new metadata schema node, if required)
* Create the dynamic metadata ACL rule
* Contribute an item

### Add user, group or role selector control to contribution wizard
From the Collection Definition Editor accessed via the Administration Console, edit a collection (e.g. Learning resources) and go to the Wizard tab. Add one of the new Group, Role or User selector wizard controls.

NOTE: A relevant metadata schema node must be created prior to configuring the wizard control (e.g. /item/itembody/Class).

### Create a new Dynamic metadata ACLs rule
1.  In the Collection Definition Editor for the selected collection, go to the Security tab, then select the Dynamic Metadata ACLs tab.
2.  Select Add  to add a new Dynamic Metadata ACL rule. Enter the following information:
* Name – a descriptive name for the rule (e.g. Class view)
* Path – select the path that matches the path selected in the User, Group or Role selector control (e.g. /item/itembody/Class).
* ID type – Select User, Group or Role IDs (depending which selector control has been configured) (e.g. Group ID)
3.   Add the ACLs that will be dynamically created for objects matching the rule.
4.  Click Save.

When a resource is contributed to the collection, Users, Groups or Roles are selected from the relevant selector and when a match or matches are found using the configured Dynamic Metadata ACL rule, the rule’s privileges are dynamically applied for that resource.

## Privileges  

openEQUELLA provides a privilege for every system task. Creating an ACL for an institution displays all the available privileges. In the Security Manager, the number of privileges for ACLs in subsequent levels depends on the child objects and associated tasks.

All privileges are listed in alphabetical order below. Privileges have an associated object and most have a textual string; however the raw privilege only, for example EDIT_COLLECTION, is displayed in the Security Manager while the associated string edit this collection is displayed to collection creators when configuring security.

NOTE: All privileges are configurable at Institution level.


### ACCESS_SHOPPINGCART
Allows users to browse catalogues, view catalogue resources, select pricing model/subscription duration and add resources to a shopping cart. Also allows users to view the active shopping cart details and submit or pay for it (depending on payment rules).
