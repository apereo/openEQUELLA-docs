## Administration Overview

This guide provides system administrators with an understanding of the openEquella administration and management tools.

The tools described in this document include the:

- Administration Console—for managing openEquella institution content, users and security.
- Institution Manager—for managing multiple openEquella institutions on the same server.
- Settings page—to manage various parts of the openEquella institution.

## Administration Console

The openEquella Administration Console provides a range of tools and plug-ins that simplify the management and configuration of openEquella.

- **Dynamic Collections**—the openEquella implementation of OAI Sets based on collection resources from one or more collections.
- **Workflow Templates**—allows content moderation and quality assurance processes to be customised and automated for each associated collection.
- **Hierarchy Editor**—configures the display of resources in hierarchies to make them more discoverable to users.
  Reporting—manages openEquella Digital Repository report availability, import and export.
- **Harvester Profiles**—manages the configuration of Harvesters for harvesting of resources into selected collections.
- **Remote Repositories**—configures external repositories which allow users to search for external resources and import results directly into a contribution wizard.
- **Courses**—configures a list of courses for use with a copyright or integrated third-party system.
- **User Management**—configures the plug-ins for user management in openEquella.
- **Security Manager**—manages the privileges associated with users and groups allowing fine-grained control of user privileges for all areas of openEquella.

The Languages page enables the use of multiple languages within openEquella and provides customization of openEquella labels and text (e.g. display titles and error messages) to specific locales. It provides controls for managing Language packs and Contribution languages.

#### Language packs

Language packs allow the default controls in openEquella to display institution-specific text such as display titles or error messages and allow users to select a preferred language for the user interface display.

#### Contribution languages

Contribution languages are defined by country and locale to allow for variations in language or dialect in different regions, for example English (United States) (en-US), English (Australia) (en-AU) and English (United Kingdom) (en-GB). Selecting a contribution language allows the user to customize any content that is added or contributed to the openEquella Digital Repository.

#### Display languages

The default display language setting is that of the browser where the openEquella instance is being viewed. Languages imported as language packs can be selected in the openEquella Digital Repository as the preferred display language. Selecting a preferred display language will override the browser locale setting.

Users can select their preferred display language on the Profile page accessed by clicking on their username at the top of openEquella pages.

## Logged in users

The Logged in users page provides administrators with a list of all currently logged in users.

To display a list of users currently logged in to the institution

1. To display a list of users currently logged into the institution, select the Logged in users link from the Settings page. The Logged in users page displays with list of logged in username, IPs addresses and log in datetimes.

## Login

The Login settings page comprises a series of controls for configuring login and authentication by IP address.

If SSL connections are to be used, it is important to note that the openEquella server must be configured to allow SSL connections prior to enabling SSL for the institution. Otherwise the institution will not be able to receive connections, thus effectively locking out all users. Ensure the Administration Console remains open until connections have been tested after this option has been enabled, to allow the disabling of SSL in the event of an error.

#### To enable SSL login

1. Check the Enable SSL checkbox to enable SSL connections to the institution. Do not check this box unless SSL has been setup on the server.

The institution login URL will be redirected from, for example: ‘http://equella.myinstitution.edu/logon.do’ to ‘https://equella.myinstitution.edu/logon.do’.

#### To configure login by IP address

## OAI identifier

The OAI identifier page enables the editing of identifier attributes.
OAI (Open Archives Initiative) identifiers are persistent URN (Uniform Resource Name) identifiers, ensuring that OAI items can be uniquely identified.

To access the identifier the /p/oai?verb=Identify must be appended to the openEquella institution URL. (Note: The /oai endpoint is available for backwards compatibility.)

For example, the following URL:
‘http://equella.myinstitution.edu’ would become ‘http://equella.myinstitution.edu/p/oai?verb=Identify’

Further information for OAI Identifiers is provided at http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/oaibp/index.php/OAIidentifiersAndRegistrationSection and http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.htm.

Users can navigate to and select a file that is automatically contributed as an openEquella resource into the chosen openEquella collection and added to the integration’s course list.

The Quick Contribute control prevents duplicate files being uploaded into openEquella.
To select a collection for Quick Contribute

1. Select a collection from the Choose a collection drop-down list.
2. Click Save.

### Version selection

The Version selection section of the Selection sessions page provides institution-wide settings for resource version selection. Course specific version selections can be managed using the Administration Console Courses tool.

Version selection configuration is used to determine which version of a resource is displayed when a resource link is selected.

Selecting the latest live version options displays the latest version of the resource when the link is selected even if the saved link is for an older version; otherwise the version associated with the link is displayed.

The options that allow a user to choose the version are enabled when adding an openEquella Resource to an item during contribution and when openEquella is integrated with a third party application such as Blackboard, Moodle or Canvas.

#### To configure version selection

Select one of the following:

- Force selection to be the resource version the user is viewing—(default option) displays the originally linked resource.
- Force selection to always be the latest live resource version—displays the latest version of the originally linked resource.
- Select the resource version the user is currently viewing—allows the user to choose between the selected resource version and the latest version of that resource during contribution when selecting existing openEquella resources as attachments. When this option is selected, a drop-down list displays on the My selections page and the user selects the required option. Fixed to v(x) is shown as the default when this option is selected.
- Always use the latest live resource version—allows the user to choose between the originally linked resource and the latest version of that resource during contribution when selecting existing openEquella resources as attachments. When this option is selected, a drop-down list displays on the My selections page and the user selects the required option. Latest available is shown as the default when this option is selected.

#### Selection options

Select the Disable the ‘Select summary page’ button on results pages checkbox to stop the +Select Summary Page button from displaying on the openEquella integration screen results pages.

#### Other tab

The Other tab provides alternative options for selecting users.

The Other tab entities represent groupings that cannot be easily specified using the Home tab. The options are:

##### Everyone

Represents everyone who can access this instance of openEquella. This group includes everyone who can access an openEquella URL and includes Guest and Logged in users.

##### The owner of the targeted object

Represents object owners, typically object creators.

##### Logged in users

Represents users who are logged in to this instance of openEquella.

##### Guest users

Represents users who can access the openEquella URL without logging in.

##### Single signed on with identifier

Represents users who are logged on using the Shared Secrets plug-in. This option is mainly for use with third-party integrations.

##### Add an IP Address

Enter an IP address in standard 255.255.255.255 format and a subnet mask in CIDR notation, a number between 0–32. The subnet mask represents the number of bits masked from the starting bit of the IP address.

##### Add a HTTP Referrer

Enter a text string that will be matched to the URL of the recipient. For example, http://institution.edu.au/equella/.

- Only match this exact referrer—the recipient URL must match the entered referrer URL exactly.
- Match referrers containing this value—the recipient URL must contain the entered referrer text string. The entered text string does not need to be a resolvable URL.

##### To add an Other tab element to the User entity pane

1. Select the required element (e.g. Logged in users).
2. Click + Add.
3. Click OK to save.

##### Create advanced user entity lists

User entity lists are expressions whose evaluation for the current user determines access to objects. The user entity list consists of user and groupings (expression operators) that can be combined to create an expression of arbitrary complexity. User entity lists can be created by identifying a user or users to be matched using the default Match Any grouping but occasionally a more sophisticated list is required. Important considerations when creating user entity expressions are:

- Readability—use the most readable expression. This makes maintenance by other users easier as the intent of the expression is clearly stated.
- Simplicity—use the simplest possible expression to achieve the required user access.
  The available groupings are:
- Match Any—equivalent to the Boolean OR operator. When used at the top level of a user expression, a user belonging to any one of the user entities in this group can use the associated privilege.
- Match None—equivalent to the Boolean NOT operator. When used at the top level of a user expression, a user belonging to any one of the user entities in this group cannot use the associated privilege.
- Match All—equivalent to the Boolean AND operator. When used at the top level of a user expression, a user must belong to all the user entities in this group to use the associated privilege.

#### Add Grouping button

Click Add grouping to add a new user entity grouping with the default Match Any operator.
