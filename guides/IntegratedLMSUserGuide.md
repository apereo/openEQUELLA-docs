## Overview
openEQUELLA is an advanced digital repository that can be integrated with a number of Learning Management Systems. openEQUELLA incorporates a digital repository and content authoring tools which enable users to search, create and manage content such as images, audio, video, packaged content, web links, text, PDFs and Microsoft Office™ documents. From within the LMS, users can create and add openEQUELLA resources to courses or contribute resources to the openEQUELLA repository.

The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate to users how to integrate openEQUELLA resources using an LMS. Individual user guides are available for the supported LMS and are linked at the end of this document. Users will learn how to search for, create and manage available resources, and how to add these materials to courses.


## openEQUELLA Integration screen
The openEQUELLA Integration screen includes the following features:
* The ability to search for resources
* The ability to sort and filter
* The ability to contribute resources using standard contributions or Quick contribute.
* The ability to Add favourites, save searches, share searches and edit resources.
* The ability to add resources to the LMS course location using either the + button or by dragging and dropping resources to the relevant location.
* The ability to view and edit selections before saving.

## openEQUELLA Integration screen elements
For the Search, Browse, Favourites and My Resources pages, the integration screen is made up of the Search/Results panel and the LMS panel.

Links are listed along the top of the screen, and can be selected to change the page view. Available pages are:
* Search (default)

* My resources
* Contribute

The Search/Results panel has relevant search options for each page, and the Results box underneath.

The LMS panel shows the Course title, and lists the Course locations. The course content page that the openEQUELLA Integration screen was accessed from is highlighted and bolded. openEQUELLA resources are selected and added to course content pages during the selection session. Selections can be previewed before they are saved to the course content pages by clicking the course content page or clicking the Review all selections link.

## openEQUELLA Integration pages
### Search
The Search page enables users to search all resources, a specific collection or an advanced search. Additionally, users can search the Cloud (OER) for matching results.
