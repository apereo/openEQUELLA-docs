# Duplicate checking

openEQUELLA 2019.2 sees the introduction of attachment duplicate checking, as
well as enhancements to the existing edit box duplicate checking functionality.

## Configuring duplicate checking

Duplicate checking is configured from the attachment or edit box wizard control
in the Collection Definition Editor, accessed from the Administration Console.

### Attachments

Attachment duplicate checking allows administrators to notify contributors of
existing items that have the same attachments. This includes _Files_ and _URL
Links_ attachment types. For example, if duplicate checking is enabled for
‘Files’ in an attachment control in a contribution wizard, the contributor sees
a **Duplicate warning** message if a file a contributor uploads is an exact
match to a file that has been uploaded in one or more existing items in the same
collection. A link is provided to those items so they can be viewed before
proceeding.

The duplicate checking for attachments is switched on in the configuration
sections for _Files_ and _URL Links_ attachment types.

#### To enable File duplicate checking

1.  From the **Administration Console**, select **Collection Definitions**. An
    example is shown in Figure 1

![](d41cade4d1f6dd6215e7bd23ff4721ee.png)

**Figure 1 Administration Console - Collection Definitions**

2.  Double click the collection containing the relevant attachment control (or
    highlight and select **Edit)**.

3.  From the **Wizard** tab, select the attachment control with the _Files_
    attachment type that requires duplicate checking to be applied.

4.  Scroll to the **Files** configuration section and check **Enable duplicate
    checking.** An example is shown in Figure 2.

5.  Click **Save.**

#### To enable URL duplicate checking

1.  From the **Administration Console**, select **Collection Definitions**. An
    example is shown in Figure 3.

2.  Double click the collection containing the relevant attachment control (or
    highlight and select **Edit)**.

3.  From the **Wizard** tab, select the attachment control with the _URL Links_
    attachment type that requires duplicate checking to be applied.

4.  Scroll to the **URL Links** configuration section and check **Enable
    duplicate checking.** An example is shown in Figure 4.

5.  Click **Save.**

### Edit boxes

Duplicate checking for edit boxes allows administrators to notify contributors
of existing items that contain the exact text string entered in the same edit
box field. For example, if duplicate checking is enabled for the ‘Title’ edit
box in a contribution wizard, the contributor sees a **Duplicate warning**
message if the text they have entered for the title is an exact match to the
text in the ‘Title’ field for one or more existing items in the same collection.
A link is provided to those items so they can be viewed before proceeding.

Duplicate checking can be switched on for multiple edit box wizard controls in
one collection. For example, duplicate checking could be enabled for both the
‘Title’ and ‘Description’ fields in one contribution wizard. Any text entered in
the ‘Title’ field would be matched against existing item titles within the
collection, and any text entered in the ‘Description’ field matched against
existing item descriptions within the collection.

#### To enable Edit box duplicate checking

1.  From the **Administration Console**, select **Collection Definitions**. An
    example is shown in Figure 5.

![](9f47579d029f2710f525f606f5bac514.png)

**Figure 5 Administration Console - Collection Definitions**

2.  Double click the collection containing the relevant edit box (or highlight
    and select **Edit)**.

3.  From the **Wizard** tab, select the edit box that requires duplicate
    checking to be applied.

4.  Select **Warn contributor if data in this field is not unique for resources
    in this collection.** An example is shown in Figure 6.

5.  Click **Save.**

## Duplicate checking during contribution

Duplicate checking occurs during the contribution and editing of items.

### Attachment duplicate checking

A duplicate warning message displays as soon as a file has completed uploading
or a URL Link is added if an exact match is identified in one or more items in
the same collection.

**NOTE: File duplicate checking works using MD5 hashes, so the same files with
different names are still identified as duplicates if uploaded.**

**NOTE: Attachment duplicate checking does not search for matches in items with
the status of Deleted, Suspended, Archived or Rejected.**

An example is shown in Figure 7.

![](0ff90b0a323b5d7b4e06087e31d53a60.png)

**Figure 7 File duplicate warning**

Click on the **Click here to view existing items that contain duplicates** link
to open the **Duplicate data** page. A list of items containing matching text
displays. An example is shown in Figure 8.

![](e0348769a9f18099d52bb4af463b655e.png)

**Figure 8 Duplicate data page**

Note that the contributor can choose to ignore the duplicate warning and save
the item without opening the link. The Duplicate data page can still be viewed
when editing the item.

Click on the item links to open the items in new tabs.

The **Duplicate data** page can also be accessed from the pages box and using
the navigation button.

### Edit box duplicate checking

A duplicate warning displays as soon as the focus moves from the edit box when
an exact match is identified in one or more items in the same collection. An
example is shown in Figure 10.

**Figure 10 Edit box duplicate warning**

Note that the contributor can choose to ignore the duplicate warning and save
the item without opening the link. The Duplicate data page can still be viewed
when editing the item.

Click on the **Click here to view existing items that contain duplicates** link
to open the **Duplicate data** page. A list of items containing matching text
displays. An example is shown in Figure 11.

![](39a2a465054b3952c1fdfdd76c1f9d28.png)

### Multiple duplicate types

In the case of the detection of multiple duplicates across edit boxes and
attachment controls during contribution, openEQUELLA shows multiple duplicate
warnings. An example is shown in Figure 13.

![](01ec08edbf93356df85e4ee1d5e3bba2.png)

**Figure 13 Item contribution with multiple duplicate warnings**

The **Duplicate data** page displays the duplicate items for each wizard control
separately. Additionally, for multiple attachment duplicates, each attachment is
listed separately. An example is shown in Figure 14.

# Displaying deleted user names

openEQUELLA 2019.2 now stores owner details in the database so that if a user is
deleted, past ownership and moderation information are not lost.

**NOTE: Users must log in to openEQUELLA at least once prior to their deletion for
this functionality to apply.**

When a user is removed from openEQUELLA, the system will now display the deleted
user’s name with the word ‘_removed’_ in brackets e.g. _Joe Bloggs (removed)_
instead of ‘Unknown user’ in the Owner field, the Moderation history page and
the Owners and collaborators page. This applies to both local openEQUELLA users
and users managed by integrated external user management systems such as LDAP.

An example of the Resource summary page for an item with a deleted owner is
shown in Figure 15.

![](b745ce1a26f4ff20693f05a43b0d4f5b.png)

**Figure 15 Owner field with deleted user's details**

An example of the Moderation history page (accessed from Details, Moderation
History) with a deleted user’s details is shown in Figure 16.

**Figure 16 Moderation history page with deleted user details**

**NOTE: If an item has been through a workflow process, the details of any
workflow task moderators that have been removed from the system display on this
page.**

An example of the **Owner and collaborators** page (accessed from **Actions,
Change ownership**) is shown in Figure 17.

![](78ed1e8ec4ed4fe4ff39e5f7d9d718f9.png)

**Figure 17 Owners and collaborators page with deleted user details**

### Filtering items with deleted owners

The existing **Show items with no owner** filtering option accessed from the
**Filter** panel on the Manage Resources page can be used to view only items
that have a deleted user recorded as the owner. It will also return any records
that have the original ‘Unknown user’ label displaying for users that were
deleted prior to the openEQUELLA 2019.2 update.

An example is shown in Figure 18.

**Figure 18 Manage resources - Show items with no owner filter option**

# Taxonomy term sorting

A new option has been added to the **Terms** tab in the _Taxonomy editor_ to allow taxonomy
terms to be sorted alphabetically across the whole taxonomy or the child terms
for a selected taxonomy level.

#### To sort child taxonomy terms

1.  From the **Administration Console**, select **Taxonomies**. An example is
    shown in Figure 19.

![](dcc2461eb4a852dede2369dae6ddd433.png)

**Figure 19 Administration Console - Taxonomies**

2.  Double click the taxonomy to be sorted (or highlight and select **Edit)**.

3.  From the **Terms** tab, right click on a taxonomy level to sort the child
    terms for that level then select **Sort Child Terms**. An example before
    sorting is shown in Figure 20.

# New taxonomy REST APIs

There are now REST APIs to:

- Create a new taxonomy
- Edit a taxonomy
- Sort each level of the whole taxonomy
- Sort child terms
- List global taxonomy ACLs
- Edit global taxonomy ACLs

To view more information and try these APIs, go to the API documentation accessed by adding **apidocs.do** to the end of your openEQUELLA institution's URL (e.g. _https//myuniversity.edalex.com/institution/apidocs.do_)

# Comprehensive modern theme for new UI

When the new user interface (UI) is switched on in openEQUELLA 2019.2, a modern UI theme is now displayed for all content by default via a new CSS. This provides a seamless and unified user experience, matching the areas that have not yet had the new UI technologies applied to those that have.

**NOTE: This is a transitionary measure until the new React with Material Design technology is applied across the openEQUELLA UI and released in forthcoming versions.**

When turning on the new UI in openEQUELLA 2019.2:

- The new theme is used by default when the new UI is switched on
- The Theming Editor now applies to all areas in openEQUELLA (not just the new UI areas as per prior releases)
- Customisations can still be applied using CSS
