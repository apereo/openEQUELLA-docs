## Searching overview
The openEQUELLA Digital Repository allows users to search, create, store, manage, view and share content. Content can include published content (resources) and personal content (files and web pages). A variety of searching methods are available for finding content in the repository, ranging from a basic keyword search to complex custom searches targeting specific resource information (metadata), to browsing specific categories.

In addition to searching, openEQUELLA provides a variety of options for sorting and filtering the search results to drill down to the specific needs of the user.

The purpose of this guide is to give users an overview of the available search options and how they can be most effectively used.
Please note that this guide has been developed to reflect the full capabilities of openEQUELLA and as such may differ in appearance from your own installation. Contact the system administrator for access to extra features or to reconfigure your installation.

## openEQUELLA Dashboard
### To access openEQUELLA
1. Open a browser and enter your openEQUELLA URL (e.g.‘http://equella.myinstitution.edu’).
2. Log in to openEQUELLA. The openEQUELLA Dashboard displays.

The openEQUELLA Digital Repository allows users to search for and discover content in a number of ways.

## Search types
There are a variety of search types available for discovering openEQUELLA content, including:
* Basic search—search by keyword, used when the resource name or keywords are known.
* Search by collection—search within a specific collection.
* Advanced search—target specific resource information (metadata) using customised search criteria.
* Search other repositories—search for records from a variety of external sources such as library databases and search engines.
* Cloud search – searches OER content stored in the cloud.
* Favourites—search within a group of resources or searches that have been bookmarked as favourites.
* Google Books™ search—search for Google Books content to add to contributed resources.
* iTunes U™ search—add tracks from iTunes U to resources during contribution.
* YouTube™ search—search for YouTube content to add to contributed resources.
* Flickr search—search for Flickr images to add to contributed resources.
* Kaltura—search for Kaltura streaming media files to add to contributed resources.
* Browse—browse hierarchy categories to ‘drill down’ to required resources.

## Search edit box
The search edit box is found on most search pages in the openEQUELLA system, and allows the user to enter keyword data to search for matching resources.

Once keywords are entered, the system can search resource titles, descriptions, attachment names and content and other metadata for matching results, depending on how the search options are configured.

### Keywords
In openEQUELLA, keywords can be entered to search for matching resources. A single keyword can be entered, or a number of keywords. The keywords must be an exact match within the resource name, description or stored keywords (e.g. openEQUELLA), otherwise no matching results will be found.

For example, entering the keyword ‘equella’ will return any resources that have the word ‘equella’ in their title, description, attachment name or attachment content (for most attachment types).

### Autocomplete
Autocomplete functionality is available in the search edit box and most keyword searches. Autocomplete means that the user can type two or more letters into the search text box and openEQUELLA will suggest resource titles based on the letters entered.
For example, if the user is looking for a resource that has openEQUELLA in its title, as soon as they type in eq, up to four suggestions display, based on relevance.

If the user is searching for openEQUELLA 6.2, typing the 6.2 will change the suggestions.
Note that there is only one matching suggestion for ‘equella 6.2’, which means there is only one resource in the openEQUELLA repository containing ‘equella 6.2’ in its title.
### Selecting a suggestion
Selecting a suggestion from the drop-down list by clicking on it, or highlighting it using the keyboard arrows, replaces what is currently in the Search text box with the selected value.

The top suggestion always defaults in the search text box in light gray. Click on the required suggestion to select.
### Multiple word autocomplete
If the user types in a single word (e.g. openEQUELLA), the suggestions will be resources with the word ‘equella’ in their titles. But if the user types in ‘equella features’, the suggestions will be resources that have ‘equella features’ in their titles in that exact order.

If a user wants to find resources using multiple keywords (e.g. openEQUELLA + guide), and there are no resources that contain the words in the exact order, the autocomplete function will suggest single words, based on words used in resource titles in the repository.
### Stemming
openEQUELLA also uses ‘stemming’ in searching. Stemming is where the system recognises the root (stem) of a word, and performs the search using the root term instead. For example, if ‘cooks’ was entered as a search criterion, the system performs a search for ‘cook´ (the stem word) and resources containing this stem would be returned, such as ‘cooking’ and ‘cooked’.

#### Multiple keywords
Multiple keywords can be entered in the following ways:
* Multiple keywords with a space between each word—entering two or more keywords with a space between each word will return results that have all of the entered keywords. For example, entering openEQUELLA features will display resources that have both openEQUELLA and features in its title, description or attachment name.
* Multiple keyword with ‘or’—entering two or more keywords with ‘or’ between each will return resources that contain either all or one of the keywords. For example, entering ‘equella or features’ will display resources that have one or both words contained within its title, description or attachment name, with the ones containing both words at the top.

### Use of a wildcard
The definition of a wildcard is a character that can be used to substitute for any other character or characters in a string. This comes in handy if the user is unsure of spelling or wants to find a range of results that start with a certain character or string of characters.

In openEQUELLA, a user can enter a character or string of characters with the wildcard (asterisk) to find any resources that start with that value. For example, the user could enter tas* to return any resources that contain the word tasmania. Any other resources containing words starting with the character string ‘tas’ will also be returned (e.g. taste, tassel etc.).

A wildcard can also be placed in the middle of two characters or character strings. For example, entering t*a will also return any resources containing the word tasmania, as well as any resources containing a word starting with t and ending in a (e.g. tarantula, tea etc.).

(NOTE: Wildcards cannot be used at the beginning of a search term.)

### Relevance scores and searching attachments
Relevance scores display for each result when a search term or terms have been entered and the sort order is set at Relevance. The relevance score is a number calculated using an algorithm based on the boost values set for title, metadata and attachments. The higher the number, the more relevant the result to the search criteria.

Additionally, if attachments have a boost value set to something other than Off (that is, attachment names and content are searched for matches to the search terms), and matches are found, Keywords found in attachment content displays next to the Relevance score.
If the boost value for attachments is set at any value besides Off, individual users may toggle the attachment search from the Results page Screen options. This allows users to choose whether they want their keyword searches to look in attachments, or only in the resource title and metadata.

## Quick search
The Quick search portlet is found on the openEQUELLA Dashboard page, and allows the user to perform simple keyword searches using the search edit box.

#### To perform a search using the Quick search portlet
1. Using one the methods outlined above, enter keywords (e.g. openEQUELLA) in the search field.
2. Click the search icon button or press Enter to return matching results. The Search page opens with the results displayed.

## Search page
The Search page enables the user to search resources using simple keyword searches, but also provides the ability to search within particular collections or perform more complex searches such as advanced searches and remote repository searches. The search page is accessed by selecting Search from the navigation menu.

On first logging into openEQUELLA and selecting the search page, the search results default is Within all resources. If the user leaves the search page after changing the search criteria, on returning to the search page, the last criteria selected will be the default.

The Search page has the Search box at the top, where criteria are selected, and the Results box displayed below.

The user can enter keywords in the search text box, and use the Within drop-down list to further qualify results. A value can be selected from the Within drop-down box without entering keywords in the search text box.

### Search options
Searching can be refined by selecting a collection, advanced search, remote repository or all resources from the Within search categories in the Search box.

### Search by Collection
Click the Within drop-down arrow to display the available search categories.

Select a collection (e.g. Learning resources) from the Collections list to display only resources belonging to that collection. If the Search field is left blank, all resources belonging to the selected collection are displayed.

### Advanced search
An advanced search provides a means of searching specifically within the metadata (information) associated with resources. It makes searching for a particular resource easier, and can be targeted to specific users, groups or roles.

#### To conduct an advanced search
1. Click the Within drop-down arrow to display the available search categories.
2. Select an advanced search (e.g. Learning resources advanced search) from the Advanced searches list. The advanced search criteria page displays.
(NOTE: The appearance of the Advanced search criteria screen depends on the design of the selected search.)
3. Select some criteria (e.g. Image in the Format of resource section) and click Search to display the search results page with search criteria in place.
4. Select Edit Items from the search box to open the advanced search criteria page and change or refine the search criteria, or Clear to remove the criteria.

## Cloud search
The Cloud search (when enabled) occurs simultaneously with the standard openEQUELLA search and searches the OER repository in the cloud. When a search term is entered in the text field in the Search box on an openEQUELLA search page and matching items are located in the cloud, the user can easily view and select cloud content in addition to local openEQUELLA content.

NOTE: Cloud search can only find matches to the text search string entered in the edit box on a search page. As the OER has its own metadata schema, it can’t use information selected from the Within drop-down list to further tailor the search results.
### Viewing Cloud results in conjunction with a local openEQUELLA search
The Cloud search occurs simultaneously with the standard openEQUELLA search, so when a search term is entered on an openEQUELLA search page and matching items are located ‘in the cloud’, the user can easily view and select cloud content in addition to local openEQUELLA content.
#### To view Cloud results in conjunction with a local openEQUELLA search
1. From the Search page, enter a search term (e.g. physiology). The matching results display in the Results box. Cloud results

## Browsing
In addition to searching, the openEQUELLA Digital Repository allows the user to browse hierarchies of logically grouped resources.

Hierarchical browsing allows users to discover resources placed within the digital repository based upon category. Users can ‘drill down’ into topics and their subfolders and search within the results. openEQUELLA can be configured to provide a count of subtopics and results and allow contributors to add their most important resources to a hierarchy topic as key resources.

Hierarchy topics are accessed from the openEQUELLA Dashboard page via the Browse portlet or from the hierarchy topic links displayed on the navigation menu.

### Browsing using hierarchy topic links
Hierarchy topic links display in a group on the left-hand navigation menu. Select a link to display subtopics and results.
When six or more topics are added, the first four plus a More... link display.

Selecting the More... link displays the Browse page with a list of all hierarchy topics.

Select a topic to display subtopics and results.
### Browsing using the Browse portlet
The openEQUELLA Dashboard page can display multiple portlets, including Browse, Favourites, Formatted text, My resources, Quick search, RSS or Atom feed, Recent contributions, Scripted, Task statistics, Tasks and Web page, depending on user privileges.

These portlets are configured by clicking from openEQUELLA Dashboard then selecting the required portlet.

#### To add a Browse portlet to the Dashboard
1. Click Screen Options from the top right-hand corner of the Dashboard page.  A list of available portlets displays. Click the Browse link to display the Create a new Browse portlet page.

3. Click Save. The Browse portlet now displays on the Dashboard page.
Select a topic to display subtopics and results.

### Displaying subtopics and results
Once a topic is selected, any subtopics are displayed. Results may also display at this point, depending on how the hierarchy has been configured. Some hierarchies may require a subtopic to be selected before any results display.


Select a subtopic to display results.

Click Add search to favourites to save the current search to Favourites.

Open the Share tab to display the Share search query pane and select the share method.

The Sort and Filter panes can be used to further ‘drill down’.

### Viewing key resources
Key resources are important resources added to a hierarchy, and are always highlighted and displayed at the top of hierarchy results.

## Search settings
The Searching and content indexing page is where default searching options are set, additional search filters can be added or edited, searching boosting is configured and content indexing options are set.

A user with administrator privileges would generally have access to these settings.
#### To access Searching and content indexing settings
1. From the navigation menu, select Settings, Searching and content indexing. The Searching and content indexing page display.

#### To configure Searching options
1. From the Default results order drop-down list, select the required default order resources will display on search results pages (Relevance, Date last modified, Title or User rating).
2. Select the Allow non-live results checkbox to show the ‘Include results that are not live’ checkbox in the Search page Screen options.
3. Check the Authenticated feeds checkbox to default to authenticated RSS or Atom feeds. If this box is not checked, users can only see public items in their feed, rather than all the results generated.
4. Click Save.

### Searching terms boost
When the results sort order is set to Relevance, and search terms are entered, the results display a relevance score.

When calculating the relevance score in openEQUELLA versions prior to 6.2, the item title was worth 1.5 times as much as content found anywhere else (metadata plus attachments). Attachment content and metadata were grouped into the same field and were worth the same.
From openEQUELLA 6.2, these weights are adjustable, and in addition the attachment content is a separately configurable weight. That is, title, metadata and attachment content can all be adjusted from being not searched at all to being 8 times more relevant.

NOTE: Different indexed metadata nodes cannot be made more or less relevant; they are all worth the same.

#### To configure Searching terms boost
1. Drag the boost variables to the required values.
NOTE: Setting a boost value to Off will prevent the system from searching in that field. (e.g. If Attachment content is set to Off, the system will not look at attachment content for matches to the search criteria.)
3. Click Save.

### Content indexing options
To configure Content indexing options
1. Select the required option from:
* Do not index attached web pages—select this option if it is not required for searches to return matching results on linked web pages.
* Index the linked web page only—select this option to index the web page of the linked URL, but no further linked web page levels. This means that searches will return matching results from the web page content.
* Index the linked web page and any secondary linked web pages—select this option to index the page of the linked URL and the next level of web pages (limit 0.5 Mb). This means that searches will return matching results from each level of web pages.
2. Click Save.

### Disable/Enable Cloud searching
Cloud searching can be disabled by selecting the Disable cloud searching checkbox in the Cloud section.

### Gallery views
In some cases, administrators may wish to disable the Images and/or Videos views. This will remove the Images and/or Videos links at the top left of the results box. Thumbnails for image and video files will still be created in the background, so if the views are enabled, thumbnails will display immediately.

Additionally, the file count that shows to the top left of image and video thumbnails when there are multiple files can also be disabled.

* Disable file count – select to remove the file count indicator that displays at the top left of thumbnails when there are multiple image or video attachments.
2. Click Save.

### Search filters
Adding one or more search filters adds those filters to the filter pane on resource results screens. This allows the user more filtering options for their search results, enabling easier discovery of resources.
Search filters are based on MIME types. For example, a filter might be required to show only resources that have image attachments.

#### To add a Search filter
1. Click the Add a new search filter link. The Create new search filter page displays.
2. Enter a name for the filter in the Name field (e.g. Image).
3. Select the MIME Types required (e.g. Image (image/gif, image/bmp etc.)).
