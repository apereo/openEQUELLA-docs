## Manage resources overview
An openEQUELLA resource typically comprises metadata (information) and one or more attachments uploaded during contribution. When a resource is displayed, important elements of its metadata are shown along with links to attachments. Modifications to a resource comprise modification of the metadata or the addition or removal of attachments.

Every resource in the openEQUELLA repository is assigned an owner, with the owner typically being the resource’s creator or contributor. Owners are typically configured with privileges to maintain their own resources, such as the ability to modify drafts, create versions and assign users for sharing ownership. The system administrators are granted more extensive privileges, having access to the Manage resources function. This function allows content and system administrators to manage resources, either individually or as bulk operations, regardless of ownership.

The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate to administrators the range of options available for resource management. The openEQUELLA My Resources User Guide provides information on managing resources for owners.

Please note that this guide has been developed to reflect the full capabilities of openEQUELLA and as such may differ in appearance from your own installation.
