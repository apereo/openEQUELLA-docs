## Harvesting guide

Content from third-party sources can be obtained by using EQUELLA’s harvesting tool that is used to collect learning objects and resources from third-party institutions and upload them automatically to the openEQUELLA repository. Content can be obtained from The Learning Federation using the LORAX protocol, while content from other institutions can be gathered with the OAI (Open Archives Initiative) metadata harvesting protocol.

Content contained in the openEQUELLA Digital Repository can also be accessed by using the OAI protocol.

The purpose of this guide is to provide system administrators with an understanding of the openEQUELLA Harvester Profile tool to enable successful management of harvesting.

Please note that this guide has been developed to best reflect the full capabilities of openEQUELLA and as such may differ in appearance to your own installation.

## Harvester Profile tool

The openEQUELLA harvester allows content from third-party sources to be collected and uploaded to the openEQUELLA Digital Repository. Content can be obtained from The Le@rning Federation (TLF) using the Learning Object Repository Access and eXchange (LORAX) protocol, while metadata can be gathered with the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) metadata harvesting protocol. Content from other openEQUELLA Digital Repositories can also be collected.

The Harvester Profile:

- provides harvesting of metadata and resources,
- allows harvesting of other openEQUELLA repositories, enabling community repositories to be created with sizable pools of content,
- allows multiple Harvester Profiles to be created and managed via the Administration Console,
- can be run as a scheduled task.

### Configure a harvester profile

Harvester profiles are created and modified using the Harvester Profiles tool available in the Administration Console.

##### To access openEQUELLA and open the Administration Console

1.  Open a browser and enter your openEQUELLA URL (e.g.‘<http://equella.myequellainstitution.edu>’).
2.  Log in to openEQUELLA as an administrator user to display the openEQUELLA dashboard.
3.  Click the Settings button to display the Settings page, then select Administration console from the categories list.
4.  Select the Harvester Profiles option to display the Harvester Profiles pane that contains a list of all previously configured profiles.

### Administration Console elements

When a tool has been selected the Add, Edit, Remove, Clone, Import and Export buttons are enabled.

#### Add

Click Add to display the Harvester Profiles Editor and create a new profile.

#### Edit

Select a profile then click Edit (or double-click on a profile) to display the Harvester Profiles Editor and modify the selected profile.

If the selected profile is being edited by another user a Locked dialog is displayed, providing the following options:

- Open as read-only—disables the Save button so that no changes can be made.
- Forcefully unlock—unlocks the entity from the previous owner. Editing is possible but changes by other users may be lost.
- Do not open—the profile configuration screen will not be opened.

#### Remove

Click the Remove button to delete the selected profile.

#### Clone

Click the Clone button to copy an existing profile. The cloned profile can then be modified by selecting the Edit button.

#### Import

Click the Import button to import a harvester profile that has previously been exported from the Administration Console. A warning dialog is displayed.

_Note: Only ZIP files that have been exported from the Administration Console should be imported—other ZIP files may adversely affect the stability of the system._

#### Export

Click the Export button to export a profile as a ZIP file.

## Harvester types

Each Harvester profile type provides options for harvesting resources or metadata from different repository types:

- openEQUELLA Harvester
- LORAX Harvester
- MEX Harvester
- OAI Harvester
- SHEX Harvester

### Add a harvester profile

#### To add a profile

1.  Click Add on the Administration Console to display a Harvester Types dialog listing the available harvester types.
2.  Select a harvester type from the list.
3.  Click OK to display the Harvester Profile Editor.

The Harvester Profile Editor provides an interface for harvester creation with the following tabs:

- Details—set general information for the creation of the harvester profile.
- Actions—perform actions on the selected profile.
- Access Control—define privileges for access to the selected profile.

Each tab is described in the following sections.

### Details tab

The Details page displays the harvester’s general details such as name, enabled status, collection to harvest to and import transformation. These elements are common to all harvester profile types.

Each type of harvester has other various configurable requirements. The Harvester Profile Editor—Details page contains configurable elements specific to the selected harvester type as well as the common elements.

The common Details page elements are:

- Updates – select how updates occurring to a resource at the source affects the harvested resource in openEQUELLA. The options are:
  - Create a new version (and archive the current version) – selecting this option creates a new version of the resource, while archiving the old.
  - Update the current version – select this option to update the resource with the changes from the source, but keep the current version number (similar to an edit).
