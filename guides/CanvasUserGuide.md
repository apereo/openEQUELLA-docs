## Canvas Learning Management System and openEQUELLA

openEQUELLA is an advanced digital repository that can be integrated with the Canvas learning management system. From within Canvas, users can access the openEQUELLA repository to search, create and manage content such as images, audio, video, packaged content, web links, text, PDFs and Microsoft Office™ documents. Content can then be incorporated into Canvas courses.
The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate to users how to integrate openEQUELLA resources using Canvas. Users will learn how to search for, create and manage available resources, and how to add these materials to courses. For information on configuring openEQUELLA in Canvas, refer to the openEQUELLA Canvas Configuration Guide.

Please note that this guide has been developed using openEQUELLA version 6.3 (GA) and Canvas and as such may differ in appearance to your own installation. Contact your system administrator for access to extra features or to reconfigure your installation.

## Adding content to Canvas course modules

openEQUELLA content can be added to Canvas course modules in two ways:
