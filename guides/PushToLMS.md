## Push to LMS overview
openEQUELLA allows LMS integration enabling direct contribution of resources into Moodle™ (Moodle) or Blackboard Learn™ (Blackboard) courses without having to access each LMS separately. This functionality enables the addition of a resource to multiple locations across courses in one process. Push to LMS also allows the user to find all the current course locations a resource has been linked to in the LMS. Additionally, the user can find all resources within the openEQUELLA system that share the same attachments.

The Manage external resources function enables administrators to view, edit, sort and filter linked LMS resources, as well as removing or moving multiple LMS resources in one action.

The purpose of this guide is to provide administrators with an understanding of how to configure the connectors required to use Push to LMS functionality and manage external resources. It also provides end users with an understanding of how to use the functionality once configured.

Please note that this guide has been developed using Moodle version 2.4 and Blackboard Learn version 9.1. (SP11) and as such may differ in appearance to your own installation.

## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this installation the system administrator will require:
* sufficient privileges to access the Moodle or Blackboard system integration functionality;
* sufficient privileges to access the openEQUELLA Security Management functionality and
* privileges to unzip and create files in Moodle.

System prerequisites for integration:
* openEQUELLA version 6.1 and Moodle version 2.1,2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 or Blackboard version 9.1 (SP8, SP9 or SP11) must be installed and running.
* Ensure that the servers have the same UTC (formerly GMT) time. As long as the UTC time is synchronised on all servers, different times and time zones can be set on each server.
* If using Moodle, the latest openEQUELLA Moodle Module must be installed within Moodle to use this feature.
* If using Blackboard, the latest openEQUELLA Blackboard Building Block must be installed within Blackboard to use this feature.

## Push to LMS configuration procedure
openEQUELLA Push to LMS configuration can be broken down into the following steps:
* Select new connector type.
* Enter configuration details for the connector then test the URL (unless setting up a local resources connector).
* Test Web Service (unless setting up a local resources connector).
* Check for new LMS functionality.

## Push to LMS privileges
There are six privileges associated with the configuration of External system connectors and the associated functionality. Four can be found in the Security Manager under Connectors and Institution, and are:
* CREATE_CONNECTOR—allows new connectors to be configured.
* DELETE_CONNECTOR—allows existing connector to be deleted.
* EDIT_CONNECTOR—allows existing connector to be edited.
* EXPORT_VIA_CONNECTOR—allows users to access the Add to external system from the resource summary page, and Edit and Perform an action from the Manage external resources page.
* VIEWCONTENT_VIA_CONNECTOR—allows users to access the Find uses function from the resource summary page.

In addition to the VIEWCONTENT_VIA_CONNECTOR, another privilege is required to allow access to the Find Uses functionality. It is found in the Security Manager under Resources, Collections and Institution and is:
* FIND_USES_ITEM—allows users to access the Find Uses function from the Resource summary page for a specific resource, collection or across an institution, depending on the level at which it is set.

The sixth is the privilege required to allow access to the management pages (Manage resources, Manage activations and Manage external resources), found in the Security Manager under Management pages and would typically only be granted to administrators. It is:
* VIEW_MANAGEMENT_PAGE


## Set up a Moodle connector
Setting up a Moodle connector will enable suitably privileged users to add resources to Moodle courses from openEQUELLA using the Add to external system link from the Resource summary screen. Additionally, users will be able to check the current usage of the resource within Moodle using the Find uses link.

#### To set up a Moodle connector

Once the Blackboard connector has been configured, a scheduled event (which runs with the Weekly Tasks) will table existing openEQUELLA resources in Blackboard and display each instance in Manage external resources.

If a resource is moved from one Blackboard location to another from the Blackboard application, the scheduled event needs to run before the new locations will display in openEQUELLA.

Prior to setting up the Blackboard connector in openEQUELLA, the openEQUELLA webservice.jar file must be uploaded in Blackboard to create the openEQUELLA web service, then web service settings in Blackboard need to be checked for correct configuration.
